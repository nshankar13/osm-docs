# Observability

## Inspect Dashboards

OSM can be configured to deploy Grafana dashboards using the `--deploy-grafana` flag in `osm install`. **NOTE** If you still have the additional terminal still running the `./scripts/port-forward-all.sh` script, go ahead and `CTRL+C` to terminate the port forwarding. The `osm dashboard` port redirection will not work simultaneously with the port forwarding script still running. The `osm dashboard` can be viewed with the following command:

```bash
osm dashboard
```

Simply navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Grafana dashboards. The default user name is `admin` and the default password is `admin`. On the Grafana homepage click on the **Home** icon, you will see a folders containing dashboards for both OSM Control Plan and OSM Data Plane.
